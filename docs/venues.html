The office had awful internet access. Personal phones did not work in the office which made things like QR Check In difficult. It would of been appreciated if staff received the Wi-Fi password for the office network. NSWEC should of activated NBN at the RO office instead of relying on hotspots which did not work.    The office was way too small for such a large council area. We often were forced to work on top of each other reducing efficiencies and remaining socially distant during the Check Count phase was impossible with teams working on top of each other. PPM training was also challenging to remain socially distant.    One area that was in our favour was that we had no attached PrePoll to our RO due to space limitations. I would recommend this universally. Attaching a PrePoll massively increases traffic around the RO.    We also benefited from our own small carpark which helped with deliveries and senior staff able to park close to the premises.","* The office had 1 smaller sized lift which made it hard to bring up all the items from the ground floor, especially as this lift was also used by other businesses in the same building. We received a delivery of 16 pallets one day. There was only room to place 2 pallets at a time in the foyer to then unload and take upstairs via the one small lift. This meant it was a lengthy process, especially as the lift was also used by other people accessing the other businesses in the building.  * There was no truck parking bay, however the Council were able to barricade one off for us in the adjoining public parking when given 3 days notice. This came with its own issues such as Council forgetting to barricade off the parking bay (we then had to turn the trucks away), barricades moved by members of the public so they could park there (trucks once again had to be turned away), as it was a public car park cars were already parked in the spaces when Council put their barricades there and we had to hope the cars might move before the truck came.  * On ROM (return of materials) night, there wasn't enough room in the adjoining open air carpark for PPMs to park temporarily whilst waiting for their turn to move into the basement carpark. I put this down to pre-Christmas shopping as the large carpark was fairly full that night. The access door to the underground carpark would only allow cars under 1.8m in due to height restrictions. All other cars had to find a car space and we then had an OA help them bring their items back which was an issue with the heavy rains that night.  * The floor space, kitchen and bathrooms was perfect in size and was very clean. Being on the top floor had its issues with many leaks from the roof and a/c system, however the building manager was very approachable and very helpful and fixed them where he could.  * My contact from Council advised a few days ago that he believes that the site is unsuitable for future local elections and he was going to discuss with the general manager to start considering a venue for the next location election now.  * There were other issues in regards to the computers but I will hopefully discuss those later in this survey.","Ground level accomodation is a must.","seating was uncomfortable for full day - ditto for electors","There were insufficient ergonomic office chairs.","Better chairs.

The secure zone was the stage of the hall and the size meant it was impossible to actually maintain security, people, especially scrutineers easily walked right up into it through the day.","Lighting was main issue.

Fortunately a location custodian was able to get us chairs on the night before polling from another building.","We were not given a key to the bathrooms so only the disabled toilet was available, not the mens and womens toilets",null,"No Kitchen facility available, had to bring kettle etc for the staff to have tea/coffee.","Messy, dirty kitchen, filthy waste area. Doors jammed closed at night. Had to exit through a shop.","Gundaroo school hall is a good venue (as opposed to the classroom block), but lack of signage and poor quality paths are an issue.","Partking for voters is quite dangerous with the number of people driving in and out of a small carpark","It was clean but we had no security for our personal items, no fridge to keep drinks cold and no warming facilities like in citizens clubs where they have all these great amenities.","No kitchen facility. Toilets a considerable distance from the polling place in a adjoining building up four flights of stairs.","No kitchen facilities","It was extremely small, the tables and chairs were old and some were stored in a mouldy shed. The venue was quite dirty. Blinds were broken. A lot of heavy chairs needed to be moved to clear the space. Fans didn't work and were noisy and dangerous - this would have been a problem if the weather had been warm. The entry space very narrow and not conducive to covid safety for people queuing.","No kitchen facilities. Only permitted to park one car on premises","Too far from the Rd. Not accessible for disabled people. No kitchen facility. One toilet for staff.","No Kitchen facilities and no cafe close by","The kitchen area wasnâ€™t cleaned and unusable .","no kitchen facilities, poor wheelchair access.",null,"Not available","The lift fpr prams and disabled people dud not work","no kitchen facilities on site","Kitchen &amp; bathroom facilities were non existent due to vandalism prior to election day","Having to go all the way upstairs for toilet &amp; meal breaks when there appears to be a kitchen &amp; bathroom closer by downstairs","Very steep access not wheelchair accessible easily or for elderly voters","no kitchen","The polling place St Michael's Vaucluse is not accessible for people in a wheelchair or with walking difficulties, due to the many stairs to get up to or down to the church hall","Library was about to undertake renovations. Had to move stockpiled furniture around to suit 3 councils. Liverpool South Ward, Camden North Ward &amp; Campbelltown. It was fortunate that due to Covid the number of voters were lower than expected. Toilets had significant infestation of mosquitoes which I had to spray. Even with the above we managed quite well, however.","Size was too small for the number of  polling staff allocated.","No kitchen facilities","There was no kitchen facility available.","Only due to COVID-19 restrictions in place, access to canteen area (that was previously available) was not available. This should rectify as COVID-19 restrictions within schools change.","It's too small for the count, and the access for disabled voters (ie those in car) very hard.","Three doors to walk through (automatic doors) to get through, one exit only and that had no accessible path so those in wheelchairs or with prams had to exit through the small doorway entrance.","No disabled access, no microwave for staff","No tables provided as per agreement so had to go to classroom and get some for use. These tables were better than the tresle tables as they tend to be too big, but moving them myself on friday night was a bit much.","There were no kitchen facilities or water available for us to use. The polling manager provided everything.","At St Lukes Enmore they were also holding their Christmas charity market day. This meant a. there were no disability parking spots; b. if someone needed wheelchair access or had difficulty ambulating, they had to go through the markets to a side entrance, rather than up the front stairs; c. there were people during set up time in the morning from 6.30 am accessing the main front entrance etc. to set up things for the Christmas markets which made it hard to ensure security and of course, to close the front door till polling opened","The location was too small for the number of staff and electors.  We weren't allowed to access most of the kitchen.  There was only one toilet.  The floor had carpet.  The room hadn't been quickly cleaned by the school/cleaners when we arrived on Friday night.","It was difficult to unload and set up. The venue had limited tables that were difficult to open up.","No parking   No kitchen","We werenâ€™t allowed to use the kitchen facilities and the toilets were dirty and the lighting was a bit dark . Otherwise the parking available was very good","Heavy tables, no parking, hard to lock up.","There are no kitchen facilities and many of the lights did not work making counting and reading difficult at night.","Kitchen was used as a Store room with no kitchen facilities available for staff.  Toilets were clean but did not have any soap for washing hands","There were only 2 ladies toilets - and one was broken. However, there didn't seem to be a queue lining up, so ladies could use it as necessary.","The room was very small (about 1/2 the size of a standard classroom). and it contained desks, computers &amp; library shelves along the walls that could not be shifted, which reduced the accessibility/usability of the space.  There was barely room to set up the polling place.  It was manageable as it was a small rural booth, but would have been much easier if it was a clear space.  There would not have been room to put more ballot boxes in the event of mayor/poll elections","A long walk for disabled people and difficult for wheelchairs","The accessibility should have been easier and more straightforward.","Lack of kitchen facility and no staff parking due to late night of counts","The school was very helpful and forthcoming regarding the issues - the school staff are in no way the target of my dissatisfaction.     However, of the keys given to me, one of the middle gates could not be opened with the relevant key, meaning that we had to exit the venue not through the main gates, and I still had to double-back to open and close these on the day.     The school hall itself was very minimal as a space, with no kitchen-like facilities. The school offered to set up a hot water urn for me and my staff, which was appreciated. The only available water was in the bubblers outside of the hall - I bought water for my staff on the day.     The toilets within the school were meant to be both boys and girls, but the keys did not open the boys toilets. So we all used the girls toilet - singular. The toilet area consisting of showers and a single cubicle. There was also no toilet paper provided at the school, I bought this item and supplied it myself. For 17 staff and various members of the public, this was not exactly ideal.","Dirty, rubbish left by previous occupant",null,"The floor was extremely slippery during the afternoon storms torrential rains. No kitchen facilities at all. No fans or cooling. It was unbearable with the heat and lack of airflow. We had to be conscious of dehydration due to the heat level in the stadium.  I was given 4 tables and 4 chairs. It was a push to get 8 more. I had to ask staff to bring their own seat to sit on during breaks. It was the worst set up and organisation for an election Iâ€™ve ever been part of.","No kitchen","one toilet &amp; kitchen was very small","No kitchen facilities (although this was disclosed already)","There was no kitchen, fridge etc so we had to bring our own and there were not enough tables",null,"No kitchen facilities and for the length of working day it would have been nice to boil a kettle for tea/coffee","We had a lot of older voters and they had to walk too far from parking on the street to get into the hall to vote. For staff parking there was only enough room for 3 cars at the back of the hall, the others had to park in the street which was a long way from the hall.","Bathrooms were not great","The exposure of the entry and exit to prevailing SW winds","No kitchen or facilities to make coffee","Staff and voter facilities - toilets, kitchen and rest areas","No kitchen facilities. Documentation stated urn for hot water would be provided, but there wasn't one.",null,"Very poor kitchen and bathroom facilities. No kettle (I had to buy one) or fridge. Single toilet (for 17 staff) had no functioning lock or door handle. No space for staff to park their cars all day.","No kitchen facilities for staff to use. Without a fridge or a microwave staff were limited as to what they could bring to refresh themselves throughout such a long day.","No kitchen to rate well and no staff parking so I am neutral about it.","The steps at Rocky River School were on both side of the buildings, making it difficult for some of the older electors to come in and out of the building, and there was no wheel chair access. Luckily we didnâ€™t have a person in a wheel chair come in. Overall I was satisfied with everything else, it was just the wheel chair access which posed a potential problem","not provided","No outside lighting at night in car parks led to a fall injury. No kitchen facilities","The hall was a mess and required extensive cleaning by PPM and DPM before setting up. Toilet facilities were very dirty and not stocked",null,"Extreamly small","No real kitchen or access to hot water.  Hall was filthy when we arrived.","There was no kitchen, but everything else was excellent","There were no kitchen facilities and one restroom that had inadequate supplies of toilet paper. I had 20+ people needing to use the one restroom throughout the day which was not functional nor covid safe",null,"Kitchen and toilets could have been more clearly communicated.","Not up to standard","no kitchen facility at the venue","It was in the middle of renovations and quite difficult for voters to access. The kitchenette was in a cleaning storage cupboard so it didn't feel clean and was tiny","No kitchen facilities available, bathroom we were told to use was right beside the head of the queue to enter the voting hall.","Way too large and no kitchen facilities","no kitchen","Ba","No kitchen at all.","Being a school library, the venue required a lot of tidying up and moving furniture around before my Deputy PPM and I were able to begin setting up the Polling Place on Friday evening which took some time. It was quite a small venue for 9/10 staff with 4 issuing tables and a declaration vote table. We had access to a mini fridge and hot water, but that was all. I couldn't find any tea/coffee supplies at the venue, but I was able to source some for my staff. That being said, the venue is a small school and the library was probably the most appropriate space to use as the polling place. Some electors did complain that it was quite far away from the entrances to the school (it was at the far northern point of the school, slightly sloping up from the entrances). The contact at the school was very helpful and accommodating, which was great.","No external lighting. Storm and heavy rain while counting. Very difficult to lock up with no lighting and sodden entrance and ground to car. I had spoken to Hall people when doing venue check.No joy. If this venue is to be used for Federal election, this MUST be rectified.","there was no staff parking even for the PPM","The Ironbark Ridge school hall is quite small.   With the covid restrictions seeing 1.5 meters gap rule for tables, screens and voters, the small booth was difficult to set up to meet the rule.    Even the principal commented that in the bigger elections (state and federal), it is quite difficult to fit all the tables and booths.  Something to keep in mind with a Federal election looming.    The other issue we had was accessing the booth the night before.  We could not get in before 6:00pm","There was no where to make tea or coffee .I had to bring cups, kettle sugar milk etc","There was no kitchen facilities","There was no kitchen facilities","Access for elderly voters from parking, no ramp and lots of stairs","no kitchen","The kitchen was very dirty.  There was evidence of mice.  There was rubbish left in kitchen from days/weeks before.  The floor mat at the exit door was a trip hazard and so we had to keep one set of doors closed to minimise the risk.","Too small for number of voters  No kitchen    No staff room or safe place for bags  Entry too small","Not a good place for elderly and wheel chair access",null,"Out of the 28 lights, 11 didn't work at all. Of the remaining 17, 5 had only one tube. Pedestal lights had to be brought from home to provide light for PPM and one Election Official. One EO couldn't work with the available inadequate lighting; she requested Ballot Box Guard duties for the day.","There was no kitchen facilities at all. We knew prior, so weâ€™re prepared for it","Very poor disability access","No parking near venue for staff - no cover to cars - we got very wet packing car after the day..","No kitchen facilities at all, only 1 toilet for all, hall was at top of steep incline with steps and uneven pavers","Wasn't any microwave and fridge.","NO kitchen facilities at all","No kitchen or fridge for staff to have a break and store food","No kitchen facilities","No kitchen","No kitchen facility available for heating foodâ€¦ kettle only","There was nowhere to take a break or take a seat. This could be down to the lack of organisational skills or care factor that my Polling Station Manager had.","Long grass bathrooms covered in spider webs","No kitchen facilities, hot water urn or microwave - Kings Langley Public School","No separate toilet only a disabled which had disability equipment on it. No separate kitchen for staff to make a coffee. The kitchen was where the voters waited to enter the polling place.","No kitchen facilities, no staff parking, no disabled parking","Nowhere for the voters with disabilities to park inside the venue, nowhere for voters to use a toilet. I understand that these might be COVID-linked problems that are particular to this election and special COVID precautions.","The toilets were hard to access for both general public and staff. No visible signage","No kitchen","Lighting. Outside under the awning was very dark and lights were broken. Lights at one of the hall were down lights and very dim for mid coast council who were at that end counting","Council had the path in Bogan St blocked off. People who parked in Bogan St had to walk on the road which is the Newell Hwy.","There was no disabled access &amp; also no suitable kitchen facilities","i believe i got the incorrect room, and due to being on the border of another electorate had lot of walk in from that electorate","cleanliness is an issue with the school","There was no kitchen and no tea or coffee making facilities available at the site.   With no food on site, and no sasauge sizzle or cake stalls etc. I had to send staff to a cafe far away to obtain food.   it was fine for me as my husband delivered food - but not so much for my staff - which I felt sorry for.","The venue was not cleaned when w arrived - it is a pre-school during the day so there  were pre-school things all over the floor. Bins were not emptied. The bathroom ran out of soap and toilet paper during the day and there was no spare supplies.","No kitchen facilities - was not allowed by school to use car park","I wasnâ€™t dissatisfied with my polling place. It was perfect in every aspect except there was no kitchen available. The school did make available an urn and a bar fridge in the day, but to fill the urn up was difficult, heavy so not much water could be placed in the urn and dangerous if the water spilt.","Was difficult to organise due to long hallway, large staircase into polling area. Also lift for accessibility was in an awkward spot for voters to enter or exit. Wouldâ€™ve been better with an entrance and exit for voters who did not have accessibility requirements as the stairs made it difficult to control entry and exit","no kitchen","Only one bathroom for 15 staff. No kitchen facilities","Not able to use kitchen/canteen to fill water &amp; use fridge.","It was out of the way and not on walking distance of many houses. The hall was 100m from the road so a long walk for elderly and others snd hard to find. Facilities there are however excellent.","Toilets long way from poling place  Entrance long walk for those with mobility issues  Kitchen long way from poling place   If rain it would have been awful for voters as poling place a long way and no shelter   Absolutely staff had a long walk for toilet in the rain","the toilets were in a disgusting state we had to clean them and provide garbage bags to collect hand towel refuse there was a leaking sink that made the floor slippery, there were insufficient tables which had to be requested to be supplied from the RO it was obvious that no one had inspected the venue prior to hiring the venue. The pre polling venue had an \"asbestos\" warning sign - that venue should not have been used","Very poor lighting, large number of bulbs blown in the venue","No accessibility - down a very steep hill.","no  controllable space for ballot papers.
