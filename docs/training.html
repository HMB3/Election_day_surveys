However I did note those that came onboard late were offered face-to-face training and I believe this offer should of been given to those RO's from the September event too. I would have gladly accepted the offer to receive more training. I felt RO's were grossly under-prepared to successfully conduct the DEC Scrutiny (which not only is a very technical task - but made even more complicated by the changes made to the EMA to allow elector IDs to be generated at the time of issuing of ballot papers). I prepared for my role for months - creating spreadsheets / tools to assist my staff / reading my SOPs multiple of times / etc, plus due to my extensive past election experiences I was able to fall back on that during the period of engagement. I seriously doubt how a RO new to the election process would have handled the pressures given we received no face-to-face training. My recommendation is 1. All staff should receive a hard copy of a manual. 2. Adequate numbers of training materials should be provided to each RO to conduct their training sessions. 3. The powerpoints provided for training sessions were rather lacking in areas which required me to supplement the slides with additional materials (like what exactly each PPM would receive as PPE equipment / what did the ballot papers actually look like / differences between AEC / NSWEC elections / a cheat sheet outlining how to successfully issue a DEC vote and which envelope to use in which situation / etc. I *strongly* advise the NSWEC to adopt a universal change around the PPM (LG.405) / SOAPP (LG.321) Registers which were very lacking. I created folders for each PPM which contained their FORM.107 Ballot Papers / FORM.123 Roll Products / LG.404 Staffing / Coloured Result Sheets / Election Day Phone Numbers / FORM.408W / Information regarding 100m Rule / 100m Radius Maps / Ward Boundary Maps zoomed in / Cheat Sheet summary of Postal Voting + iVote + PrePoll Locations / copies of EL.136 / EL.191 / EL.199 / LG.213 / LG.429 / LG.233H / EL.654 / EL. 655 / EL.110 / EL.128 / LG.418 / Coloured Ballot Box + Table Signs to match the colour of the ballot papers per ward. The Registers were not perforated so forms could not be taken out easily + worse still the forms were printed double sided which means handing out a Scrutineer Appointment form was impossible because on the reverse side was your WHS Checklist Form. A display folder costs $2-$4 each and is worth the effort to help support PPMs. I received amazing feedback from my PPMS who were most appreciative of the folders with several Deputy's who were asked to step up to PPM level last minute due to PPM dropping out mere days before the election that the only reason they accepted the offer was because the folder was so well organised. During training we went through the folder and what form was used for what purpose. This was totally lacking in the PPM Powerpoint provided by the NSWEC.","a group training session prior to starting work","As previously suggested, the declaration scrutiny manual requires a lot of updating, showing examples of what to do when dec envelopes aren't filled out correctly, how to search for voters that are hard to find.

The maps provided do label these but most go to the polling places without any understanding of how they could be gainfully used and so are NOT used and eg Dec Votes are unnecessarily issued creating confusion and delay. The big maps are not useful to issuing staff simply because they are too cumbersome to be easily available in most cases.   Also, clear statements about how dec votes issued to people who are not found on the roll but have advice from AEC that they are enrolled would make it easier for all staff and voters to manage the process at issuing points.

I think that improving training for managers would assist teams - and training them to acknowledge the skills and experience of other team members would help.

At my pre-pol location there was no consistency between issuing officer's instructions to voters. e.g., Apparently the video (which I never saw) stated that voters must fill in 5 boxes below the line for the councillors while the ballot paper only specified at least two (at my booth).  There were discrepancies for nearly all the instructions which meant the election was not really fair and I was not at all surprised the informal vote was so high.

It seemed even the Booth Manager was unaware of how to fix some of these complex issues on the day and what should be done when those things donâ€™t actually work as per the manual and training. I managed on the day to do my job the best I could and with more manual methods than I had trained for. And it was very successful luckily. But with an on-line roll that wouldnâ€™t work and no Internet - it made the day far more busy and when we rang â€œregionallyâ€ as we were nearly out of envelopes etc - we were told â€œthatâ€™s a problemâ€ - â€œwhat do you suggestâ€? If people more senior canâ€™t give solutions - it seems that more training or ideas need to be put in place for when the unthinkable or rarity happens - so solutions can be found. And no one who comes to vote has their voting ability put at risk due to systems failures and no solutions. Luckily on the day we worked around it. The public/ voters were very understanding overall. But it made my job and the the day extremely stressful - as the Declaration Officers job (mine on the day) was fraught with stress and unanswered questions and no solutions from â€œhigher upâ€! We had to basically fix our own issues and come up with solutions ourselves at the booth. And do it to the highest level of professionalism and integrity as we knew we could. But this may not be the case in other places. And no voter should have the integrity or ability to vote jeopardised by poor processes and lack of supportive back up solutions for those of us working at the booth.","Make the link in the email easier to find.

I hope to cover them in other answers.  Having read through the entire questionnaire, I have returned here to offer a number of observations.    (1) There were no absentee votes; around 20 electors were attempting to do so.  Consideration needs to be made on how to advertise this before the poll.  (1a) Electors were advised of their three options to cast a vote.  The first was to return to their council area before 6pm to vote.  Some electors from within the council but not in the correct ward were advised that they could travel to another polling place around 20km away to cast their vote.  Some did so.  (1b) Electors were advised that iVote was availableâ€¦***however iVote was down on polling day***.  A number of electors had already tried to iVote on the day, and had duly arrived at a polling place to do so.  (1c)  Electors weâ€™re invited to fill out a â€œreason for failure to voteâ€ form.  Dozens did so.  (1d) Electors were reminded that prepoll voting is available for future voting in Council Elections.  Please note that as far as I can tell, there are no provisions to provide a ballot paper for Mayor to electors from the correct council but who are in the wrong wardâ€¦    (2) Multiple electors were able to show a copy of an email from the Electoral Commission confirming that their roll details had been updated. Some had done so relatively recently, which would explain why this was not shown on the physical rolls. Some had an email from over a month prior to polling day.  I could offer no e plantation as to why their details had not been updated on the *electronic roll*; electors were understandably and noticeably distressed at having to complete an â€œupdate elector details formâ€ AGAIN.    (3) No training was provided on what to do if as a polling official I was notified of a deceased elector.  I initially recorded all the necessary details and only later in the day inspected the â€œfailure to voteâ€ form and it is a reason.  I duly filled out said form on behalf of the elector whose spouse had died.","Human/public response training is important","Ensure adequate space and equipment when performing practical part of the face to face training","No","A possible look book for formal verses informal to have as a reference when completing the sorting process.","More cases","No","There have been already multiple  choice questions or true and false questions online .

I had a lot a people that didnâ€™t have the correct address on the Electoral Role. This added to the queuing for Declaration Voting. Firstly there should be a media  campaign in the lead up to the election to help minimise this. Secondly this was major reason for increasing the number of people staffing the Declaration Voting.

It was very rushed, contact details, names were on slides and people had to take screenshots, why not provide these in hard copy.","I can't really answer that","No idra","No","Face to face - more","No","N/A I find the videos provided on the address tablets helpful","no","Was Good having the On Line Manual but needed the printed Manual to highlight &amp; insert page markers.","No","No","Examples / case studies are the most useful part of the training.","In exam state 1 or more options can be chosen","no","No","n/a","No","There is not enough payment for training.

Knowing I would receive a hard copy I didn't want to print out the manual and reading it on soft copy is not ideal for me. I did the on-line training a couple of weeks before face-to-face so had forgotten some of the detail. If I had the manual I would probably have reviewed it before the face-to-face training and perhaps got more out of the face-to-face training. This was only a minor issue as I reviewed the manual multiple times after the training anyway","The DDPMs were not given a physical manual - which made it very hard to apply anything to the day","More on packing requirements for each type of return","-","Maybe more face to face training","Some was repetitive in the manual and video.
