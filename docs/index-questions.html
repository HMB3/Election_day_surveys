<h3>Index Calculation</h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the formatted staff survey data table, rows are people (i.e. ‘respondents’, n=10899), and the columns<br />
are questions (n = 382, indcluding all sub-questions). To analyse the survery results numerically, the original<br />
survey responses have been transformed, so every staff response (i.e. row) is assgined a numerical, ordinal<br />
value representing postive or negative responses (i.e. a whole number from high to low). For example, for<br />
the five-scale satisfaction questions, transformed numerical values are as follows:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Very satisfactory ~ 5</strong><br />
<strong>Satisfactory ~ 4</strong><br />
<strong>Neutral ~ 3</strong><br />
<strong>Unsatisfactory ~ 2</strong><br />
<strong>Very unsatisfactory ~ 1</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For the questions in other formats (e.g. yes/no/uncertain), we use two different transformations -<br />
one where yes is positive, and one where no is positive (depending on the context of the question):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Yes ~ 3 (or 1)</strong><br />
<strong>Uncertain ~ 2 (2)</strong><br />
<strong>No ~ 1 (or 3)</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Using these numeric values, the overall index for each topic is calculated as the sum of all questions<br />
in that theme for each respondent (i.e. row), divided by the maximum possible score for each topic -<br />
but only for those people who answered each question in that topic. For example, the Staffing Index has<br />
four questions, two yes/no questions, and two satisfaction questions, with a maximum score of 16. If<br />
a particular respondent only answered the two satisfaction staffing questions, their individual staffing<br />
score would only be divided by the max score of 10 (2*5). However, the score of a respondent who answered<br />
all staffing questions would be divied by the maximum of 16.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>These respondent-level indexes give a better indication of the variation in survey responses across the<br />
whole survey, rather than aggregating the index scores to some arbitary unit (for example the spatial unit<br />
of Venue or the RO Office where each staff member worked). The boxplots below show the variation in the index<br />
scores for each topic across all responents, using the standard format of the five-number summary (<strong>Fig A</strong>).<br />
The minimum and maximum values are shown by the whiskers, the first quartile (Q1) is the lower half of each<br />
coloured box, the median value (centre of the distribution) is the solid black line, and the third quartile<br />
(Q3) is the upper half of the coloured box. For example, Index values for the IS topic varied more than for<br />
the Training or WHS Topics, due to the nature of the questions chosen for each Topic’s index. To further<br />
illustrate the point, the variation in each index is also given in table form below the boxplot.</p>
