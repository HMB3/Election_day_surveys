Also there were some differing opinions on the best ways to do things when it came to counting.  Perhaps a time and motion study with a best practices would be good to help improve speed and accuracy while reducing time and recounts.    5. A set of clearly printed cards on operations to refer to on the day would greatly help peoples recollection on what they remember from the training videos.    6. The interface of the online learning portal system is a little clunky compared to modern Learning Management Systems.    7. A clear explanation of the duration of working tasks and hours would help in the job description, or at least in the training. There were several of us who where surprised to discover that the day ran from 7am until whenever the vote count was finished (14.something hours all up at the booth I was at). I was under the mistaken impression/assumption that they were separate roles, or perhaps there were two shifts as such. I didn't actually know we were counting as well as the checking people off the roll. Other newbies had similar ideas.    8. Speaking of counting votes...... I don't recall any of the training videos mentioning anything about counts. To be clear, I'm not talking about whether or not a ballot was eligible or not, or how to categorize the ballots for first preference - those things were covered in detail in the training.   What I am talking about the counting part. More specifically, how to count large volumes of sheets of paper accurately and fast. Like a demo using the finger rubber tips. How not to lose track of where you are up to when someone inevitably interrupts someway through a stack of papers. Thankfully one of the more experienced election day people showed me how the use the rubber finger cover. Rather than leave that knowledge to that chance of who is working at a particular polling booth, I feel a video that covers good manual paper counting techniques would be beneficial to anybody attending the day, because if you don't know the technique (like I didn't ) or are out of practice, it is a very slow and sometimes frustrating process when sheets stick together.

I have been working on elections (federal &amp; state) for 28 years and have much experience including pre/post polling at RO's, incl. compliance manager and polling manager. The minute he was able he had me removed as 'a trouble maker' as he was aware I knew he was totally inept so I lost an entire week's wage. The Manager and SOASV believed him and didn't bother to redeploy me stating the policy that they didn't HAVE TO. He couldn't cope with the workload for one day so they had another replacement go in who had minimal experience. I worked as the Polling Day manager at the same site and then was given work at RO Wollongong post polling doing data entry. What I have come to realise is that so many people make claims in their job applications that are untrue about their skills and experience. Neither of the 2 senior \"staff\" at the RO Wollongong had any idea HOW TO deal with someone of this calibre. I am submitting a report of the totality of this man's indiscretions and questionable behaviour separate to this survey as it needs to be read to be believed. I am the one that worked with integrity, honesty, diligence. I was the one that trained the staff in what needed to be done. I was the one that corrected him because he was processing electors incorrectly. And I was the one to be removed by a person, who if in years to come is allowed to continue, will become a danger working on elections when he becomes familiar with the systems. He works as a bouncer at a night club and for the 6 days I was there he had streams of \"mates\" coming in and \"having a chat\". He is a misogynist which became more apparent as the week wore on with his aggressive speech directed at myself and another female OA where he swore at me on two occasions and yelled directions on others. His treatment of the 2 men was the opposite. Having reviewed information on the NSWEC website there is no platform to be able to make a complaint against someone as abhorrent as this which in effect means that the platitudes of the NSWEC are just that. For all the noise about integrity, honesty, code of conduct there is NO AVENUE to have the staff protected when someone of this calibre does what they do because you start to realise EVERYONE up the chain is a casual recruited for the EVENT and they don't want TO KNOW ABOUT IT because they do not have the staff management or HR knowledge to be competent in their roles.","The definitive answer came just few days starting so I didnâ€™t know if I had to search for another job when waiting for answers",null,null,null,null,null,"Better communication regarding training sessions.

He had no presence and the 2IC and me (a previous 2IC) were instructing staff on procedure. It was not my job, nor the 2IC, to do what we did on the day, but if we had not, many of the first time employees (about 4) would not have known how best to work each position. Luckily, those new staff members followed the experienced staff, so the booth ran smoothly. No credit to the Manager, although he took the higher pay on the day.  New recruits, or those who have never worked before, should be limited at each booth. One or two new recruits is manageable, not half of the work force.  the person employed to do the Declaration Votes had never done that job before and had no idea how to do it. Another employee on the day, then a second experienced employee, took over the Declaration Votes table and the booth ran smoothly.

Was a tucked and hidden away. Needed to be a bit of a treasure hunter to find the place. I strongly recommend in future keep elections in the places they have always traditionally been in our case the local public school. Less confusing that way. Secondly - the switch to only local wards (no very close adjoining wards) was a bit of a disaster. It was also a big change from previous years. The electorate does not respond well to big changes. Even us election staff had trouble dealing with these changes and managing the fallout of those changes. Further (and this will almost certainly not improve) it would be good if local, state and federal electorates/LGA's (and wards inside) matched up concurrently. Causes tonnes of confusion out there. Need better education of public on this with handy little \"how to do elections\" cards/sheets or something - from knowing your electorate/ward to how to register etc. More than just the website. Even us officials were left scrambling trying to find where the ward boundaries were etc. Thirdly - need better tablet devices that are not deteriorating into oily, rubbery grits from previous sun exposure/wear and tear. That are pre-loaded with up to date and handy info on for e.g. ward boundaries etc (with maps) and top internet wireless connectivity. This was not really the case on election day. I had to scramble and use my own smartphone and wireless data plan and hope and pray it worked out. It did, but that was far too ad hoc and nail bitery for my tastes! Fourthly - Procedures and material and training for my current role - declaration officer is notoriously tricky and difficult to master. The main reason being it handles so many random unique cases. Was a bit obscure how to deal with cases on the day. Scenarios not in the training material came up on the day. Felt like being a constitutional lawyer trying to interpret the legislators original meaning in an Act of Parliament. While me, and our top manager guy, do have skillsets that rose to the challenge - that was more by luck/personal skill, not from training or failsafes. This is very hard to explain as the devil is in the detail. I know this however - the 2019 federal election I worked for handled this better - although it was also quite tricky, prone to misinterpretation and generally not as robust and foolproof as it should have been. I think declaration voting needs to be gamed out better for all the weird and wonderous variations that can occur and then train for that accordingly. And clearer rulings and guidelines. Set it out as clearly as a nearly written set of tax laws. So we don't waste time, like we did a bit on the day, pondering over interpretations. We were lucky - we had no high volume rushes (hidden at the back of our local TAFE), but we could have and our service needs to be more foolproof and streamlined and fast.","Not really","Do more in community, like posting it in library, centerlink or NSW Service etc.","No I think you have it covered","social media","Flyers to be included in council rates notices","I live in the ACT and would not have known there were opportunities, unless I had previously worked for your organisation.","No suggestions","newspapers  - employment agencies","Face Book Ad","Put articles on local weekly magazine e.g.Canberra Weekly  Notify Senior Card holders if they are interested in working  for the NSWEC or AEC","Online promotions as well as tV ads","I don't have any other suggestions at this time.","n/a","All good","Promotion via television","not right now","No suggestions","Social Media","I think most promotional avenues have been covered.","No - well covered.","letterbox drop","advertise in the council newsletter","all seems to be covered","No","The experience was very satisfying and enjoyable.","nope","No suggestions as very happy with way it was done","none.
