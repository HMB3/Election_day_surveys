We instead let each PPM take as much covid stuff as they felt was neccesary (on top of an already full box of various ppe) and they only used about 10% of our stock of masks. After the election, we were lucky to find a group of workers who said they had a use for them, and they filled two trucks with masks.

Which some of us thought was rude, Embarrassing him.and unnecessary. In the grand scheme of things, one person not having a mask on would not be that detrimental and is it worth making a person feel ostracised in public over.    2. So manu voters asked for pampletson who the candidates were and we were advised to tell them we didn't have any, but there were 2/3 folks outside, only allowed several meters from the pollign station, with info BUT they were not allowed to hand out papers due to covid. So ridiculous.     there's no consistency on covid rules. We don't allow even one person without a mask - only to single them out publicly.  We (as workers) tough the ballot paper with bare hands and give them to voters (so we're not bothered about hygiene), yet we force every person entering a voting station to sanitise their hands yet again (no doubt they've just done that 10 times during their errands prior to comign to vite).    My summary is that we're a bit over sensitive on covid. it's something we all will be living with but there's no need to ostracise or force someone to have to sanitise their hands again.

As given Covid symptoms - there was no guaranteeing that they didnâ€™t have Covid.   I also felt that on 3 occasions it there were voters/ members of the public that seemed highly sick, running noses and coughing who (despite wearing a mask) were clearly sick and shouldnâ€™t have been allowed into a building seemingly that infectious or sick. One gentleman in particular had his nose running down through his mask and coughing so much he was â€œfoamingâ€ the outside of his mask whenever he coughed with mucus. And he kept wiping his hands on his mask.  When these issues were brought to the attention of more senior people - it was stated that there was nothing to stop anyone coming in to vote.  Whilst I feel overall the procedures in place (including hand sanitiser, compulsory mask wearing, single use pens, regular cleaning, Checking In via NSW App and / or manual sign ins) was excellent - and given that Covid is a long term issue for our country/ societyâ€¦I do think that there needs to be more done in the future. Maybe temperature checking people as they come in - vaccine mandates for voters (unvaccinated people can vote online or via postal vote) etc. As it seemed on the day we had people who were possibly very sick or contagious coming in and voting. Some of the OHS issues around future elections need to be updated to ensure other voters and staff are protected. All staff were required to be double vaccinated - and that was great. But the buildings voting takes place in are not always well ventilated and sick staff shouldnâ€™t be allowed to work (unfortunately) and visibly sick members of the public shouldnâ€™t be allowed to vote in polling booths either. This protects other voters and it protects staff as well - who are already dealing with a lot of people in an enclosed space every day.   Maybe even using Rapid Antigen Testing on staff the morning of the election would ensure staff safety more. And keeping mandates for masks etc in place for voters.

The PPM was unsatisfactory. He was making personal calls for most of the day and was barely present in the polling area. He also made an unnecessary scene when a voter refused to wear a mask.

The deck on that side was also very worn. The sun also got quite hot on that side so we ended up using the front door and exit via the left hand side still - which meant then that the 6m boundary was then out on the road.

His name was Sam, and his contact number is 0439 996 820 however, I am unaware of his surname.     While working with him during the day, my colleagues and I witnessed unacceptable work behaviour from him. There were several incidents during the day.     On one incident, a young male elector came to the venue asking Sam about why Sam had lied to him. Same responded that he did not lie and raised his voice at the elector. Sam repeatedly yelled â€˜Get out! Get out!â€™ at the elector and gave him a hard to time. Instead of deescalating the situation, Sam further frustrated the elector and created a hostile environment that was unsafe for the rest of us. A short while later, the elector came to me for help. I used one of the iPads to check his details to see if he could vote at our venue. Sam then ran towards me and pulled the iPad off my hand and screamed at me in front of other electors and staff. He screamed at me saying that he had told me not to help this elector and he yelled â€˜I am the boss, I am the boss, you cannot do anythingâ€™. This was extremely humiliating and made me feel very distressed and unsafe.     Another incident occurred while I was searching the iPad for an elector whose name did not appear on the role. The husband-and-wife electors were sitting across from me on the table. Sam came next to me while I was searching on the iPad. He began leaning on me, so I tried to distance myself from him. However, he continued to lean further each time I moved away. He got so close to me to the point that he was almost on top of me, so I got up from my chair completely. The electors were looking at me in understanding of Samâ€™s inappropriate behaviour. This was sexual harassment which is not appropriate in any setting. Sam had no right to invade my personal space and project himself onto me.     It was an extremely unpleasant day working with Sam for myself and the other staff and electors. He was unknowledgeable about the processes and requirements of the day and completely unprofessional. I am happy to provide witness contact details to speak on Samâ€™s behaviour.     I would greatly appreciate if some disciplinary actions were taken against Sam for his misconduct on the day.

She was never put on the desk for the electoral roll mark off and in speaking to her I don't believe that was her choice. I found that unconscious bias most uncomfortable. Maybe your managers and supervisors should be trained in that aspect",null,"No - have used this venue for elections on other occasions and am familiar with the school.","Needed good tape for power cord placement on floor, and hazard tape for trip hazards",null,"EEC should look at different queueing methods   Airpirts  Supermarkets to get clients through quicker",null,"There was one voter who should have been escorted outside by security had that option been available.","Proximity of voters to tables was less than 1.5m","There were no coffee and tea making facilities nor anywhere to sit and have our breaks.

There was no one to keep them clean. In current COVID times, this was especially a huge risk. There should be cleaners allocated per Election venue",null,"Box of cleaning and sanitizer was too heavy. Two smaller boxes more appropriate than one very large and heavy box. Still need to get it in and out of the car and into the venue.      For a venue with a little under 1,000 votes, it is a bit unfair to expect them to pick up and deliver the huge cardboard voting booths.

Consideration needs to be given to the conditions and hazards on rural roads and not just the distance to travel.","There was no training or discussion prior to the count. Therefore some people unfolded whilst others sorted. In the 25+ years I have worked we have been asked to unfold all first before sorting.  I found one person who took a photo of the comments left by a voter, I explained that he was not allowed to do this and reported to OIC who took no action. The OIC was off site quite a few times for extended breaks.","Lack of fresh air in the venue",null,null,null,"I found that working with other staff we were too close. We had problems with voters cramped together within the 1.5m distance.

The other, the DDPM dealt with and he decided not to vote and left the building.",null,"It was an extremely hot and humid day, the venue was not air conditioned and wearing vest and masks exacerbated the heat. I ended up with heat exhaustion.",null,"Whilst I was on the door, a male refused to QR Check In and refused to wear a mask despite not being able to produce a medical exemption. The situation escalated and I enlisted the assistance of the manager who, in my opinion, heightened the potential risk by arguing with the male. Eventually the male left however the situation was distressing to other voters and staff who witnessed the verbal exchange. It highlighted to me that there was no training for staff to deal with these types of situations. In hindsight, my response should have been to ask the male to leave and when he did not, I should have called the authorities as he had breached a public health direction. We all may have benefited by having that on a poster  along with an emergency procedures pocket-sized card.","The heat in the stadium.  Lack of seating  Slippery floor (itâ€™s a basketball stadium) and we had storms the whole afternoon/ evening.","Movement breaks","Better triage of voters so to avoid them getting sent from ordinary voter officer to declaration vote table","It was crystal clear that 60% of the staff at the polling booth did not undertake the training because I had no idea what they were doing when it came to counting. This made the counting at the end of the night drag on for an extra hour and 30 minutes","At pre-poll venue, serious water leak in ceiling of kitchen, flooding floor during overnight rain. Signage and crates to hold it.   Very angry members of public and had to threaten to call police. Abusive voters. As manager, I was told to enforce 100 metre rule in street, deal with aggressive voters and one aggressive staff member who threatened me. Made to feel that I was inadequate or at fault in some way for not knowing how to deal with it as well as coping with regular voter flow with insufficient staff. And wifi drop-outs which led to longer queues and more aggression.",null,null,null,"As noted regarding the infection control concerns","It was awkward that there were no public toilets available and no wheel chair access. This was made more awkward because the place for us to eat our food and have our break was where the public came to request these two things","Documentation for final counting was 1960's paper system.  Has anyone ever heard of Xcel sofware.....wish I was a software salesman selling Xcel ?????","Chair quality was very bad and hard to sit on all day.","The Returning Office was a distance from the most polling place.  To get to it needed to travel on a dark high risk road.","There was no paper towel to dry hands in the staff bathroom.The manager had to bring theirs","TO keep a safe social distance between electors and workers, it is definitely necessary to have a more spacious area between desks, voting screens and in the queues.",null,"Need a first aid kit box and more relaxing chairs to sit","Setting up secure area required crawling under a stage to find a power point","Mobility scooters in a small venue are hard to manage","I had to chaperone (accompany on walk home) of an officer who felt sick, dizzy.

Another official commented that she was pleased I used the facilities at the same time as her, as she didnt feel safe being back there on her own.  I felt exactly the same.

I felt like I was not wanted because of my age. Age has  never been an issue before for me. I still feel weird about it. I came with the most life and skill experience and felt it was not recognised, that younger people were preferred. I still have another 10 years employment before retirement.","The polling managers Sinni and Majella had little regard for the health and safety of staff. At the beginning of the day we were told there would be rotations between staff per station - marking off the roll, ballot boxes, cleaning and organising voting areas and checking sign ins at the door to ensure roles were equitable. This was not the case at all. Sinni and Majella had a handful of â€˜favouritesâ€™ who they kept on the relatively less strenuous role of marking off the roll. The rest of us were rotated between strenuous roles and were only given a chance to mark names off the ballot during breaks. I gently asked on a couple occasions if I could have a chance to rotate to a desk role as I had been on my feet for 10+ hours. I was ignored. I was told by my mother that was also working that Majella had told her â€˜favouritesâ€™ that I was lazy and had been complaining. This is unprofessional and unacceptable. Staff were provided no support in times of difficulty, Sinni and Majella would swiftly throw us under the bus to make themselves look better and were consistently micromanaging the team.     There appeared to be a level of incompetence from Sinni and Majella with the vote reconciliation. All of the staff worked hard to accurately count the votes which was completed at 9:00 but we had to wait an additional hour and a half for this to be finalised. This demonstrates an inability for them to balance the numbers and perform their role. There was also no communication to the team on what the issues were or how we could be doing other roles to ensure the centre was clean and packed up. Sinni was rude to the scrutineer, often raising her voice and being condescending when he was just doing his role. She even raised her voice and was not very respectful when she called in the votes.     Overall, the polling managers were very unpleasant to work for. This sentiment was shared by the majority of people at the Drummoyne public school polling centre. My experience with them would be enough to make me never to want to work an Election Day again. I think there is much room for improvement with both their management skills and general people skills as I saw them treat voters in a similar manner.",null,"Scutineers - I do not know if the polling place manager checked they had double vaccination certificates, maybe he did- bif so, he should have told us he had verified this,  Once the doors shut, at 6 pm , the hall had poor ventilination as some windows did not open,   we did without \"air breaks\" re covid mitigation, as I dont think the manager had a good understanding of covid safe practices re airflow. of course the managers goal was to get counting done asap  The lighting in the hall was inadequate and needed to be checked and fixed up  by the  bowling club before the election day.   the toilets were very clean. thanks.   the kitchen had a fridge and urn- thanks","Just make sure the managers know they need to stay if the declaration table is out of balance, not all 10 staff, when the rest of the room balanced in 4 mins","When standing to direct electors it would have been great if a small rubber mat was available to stand on as the concrete surface was extremely tiring on the feet.","Pack down is a physical task at the completion of a long day some workers need to be fit enough and willing to perform these tasks",null,"Letting us know where we could park and how safe it would be to get to your car after working","Given the hours worked and length of day (i.e. 7.15 am to 8.45pm or longer).

I was on the COVID cleaning job 90% of the day, while other workers got to sit down all day.",null,"There was no kitchen facility for staff to prepare tea and coffee or to keep their food refrigerated.","the PPE hand sanitising box was over 15kgs which is difficult to load and unload into car boot - if providing boxes that would weigh more than 10kgs need another box. While not for me personally NSWEC needs to get trolleys with 4 wheels and not use the 2 wheel pull back variety as this needs extended force to tip back and not lose the boxes. At the returning office, the need to do this was about 20 times as the queue moved along. This would have caused muscle strain. Having a trolley with the 4 wheels meant it was just a push situation.",null,"The toilets were not clean enough",null,"None.

The ground from car to venue was uneven and hard to negotiate with a trolley.","We started very early 7:15am and finished at 8:45pm. We were only given one 30 minute break. There were no facilities with hot water for tea or coffee, or a room  to sit and have the break. Some staff sat in their cars for the break.  There were no toilets for staff, we had to use ones that the public were using.","no outside lights very dangerous walking on uneven ground to carry supplies and boxes to the car","Improvement opportunity has been suggested in the H&amp;S form in the PPM Register.","An elderly voter accidently fell in the ground. I believe he was trying to balance himself and tried to hold the Both which was very light therefore loose control. My colleague quickly brought the First aid box, available to use the bandages to stop the bleeding cut by the watch he was wearing. All went well one of his neighbor took him home. After witnessing this incident l approached all the elderly voter's during my duties at the door and offered them chair while waiting, was very much appreciated.","Cardboard booth is too unstable as I saw three examples of elderly people losing balance as they think they can weight bear.

Unsafe as single female walking to car.","Election officials knowing they are not to touch other officials","The hours required for set up and the limited time slot to do it. My venue was running an after school care program so we were not permitted to set up until after 6:00pm. We were there until 9:00pm with a 6:00am start on Election Day.

I parked on the road and could have parked closer.","Despite Covid awareness, the exit of voters was such that they had to walk back through and close to those lined up to vote. The Flow was not well designed.","The fluoro light cover above one of the station was insecure and could have caused injury","Access to the hall had a slight lip which impeaded some electorâ€™s access, it made it hard for wheelchair and walking chair people to enter safely","I could not help noticing that although duties were rotated regularly only the women were asked to do spray and wipe of areas used. In other words only the women did cleaning duty.","The school was supposed to supply tables and chairs, however, there were none provided. We found some in other buildings and had to carry them from one building to the polling place and return them in the evening in limited lighting as there was limited lighting in the school at night. Leaving the polling place we were using the phone torch of the manager.","The tables used to count on were too low, causing unnecessary back strain.","I believe a lot of workers including myself did a lot of standing. I tried to sit down when possible but you truly need more breaks when you are doing these jobs. The greeting the people and directing them to where to stand so they could be next in line. I've got a back and leg condition and was told I'd have a fully sitting down job which was the agreement that I worked as I've done this before but the amount of standing made it that for the following 2 days my feet were so swollen for standing for very long periods of time that I had 2 days of sheer hell with the pain I went through.

Can there be a few fresh staff in the evening to assist the count","I had difficulty when it came to phoning in the results and the recorded messages kept telling me to ring back later before disconnecting. I had tried for 30 minutes to get through at my polling place, then decided to let the staff go and I drove to the hall nominated as a collection point. I tried constantly between 8.15pm and 9.45 pm to get through to someone to pass on the results. I was developing a migraine and was worried about being able to drive home safely so I rang our returning officer and luckily he understood and was able to take the results over the phone. There were insufficient people on the phones and even when you seemed to get through to a voice message and were placed on hold, the call did not stay in a queue and was disconnected. Extremely stressful. There needs to be a better way to manage this next time.","Not enough toilet rolls in the toilet.

In a pandemic situation, this issue needs to be taken very seriously.  3. My role was to greet people and to guide them to the correct counter to receive the ballot sheet and it required me to stand all day long.

It would be helpful to have signs reminding parents to keep their unmasked kids back from staff at the tables.",null,"Venue suitability - Wifi for QR check ins didn't work most of the day, had to manually record electors attendances.  Phone service was terrible for check in calls and if we had experienced an emergency we would have been in trouble.
