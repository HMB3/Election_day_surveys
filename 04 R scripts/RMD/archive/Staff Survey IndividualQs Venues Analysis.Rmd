Index analysis
=====================================

Column {data-width = 1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Column {data-width = 12}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

\

The following analysis is based on Venues  questions in the SG19 staff survey,
using only complete responses (n = 1356). The original data has been transformed,
so every staff response (i.e. row) is assgined an Index score between -1 (negative 
responses) and 1 (positive responses). The graphs below show that Index scores for 
questions relating to Venues  for each Venue/District (Fig A). Overall, Venues  questions 
scored similarly to other topics - statistical analysis shows that the Venues  Index 
scores are not significantly different to other topics (Fig A). 

\

Within the Venues  scores, all Roles gave mainly positive feedback, while Statistical 
analysis showed that the differences between the Venues  Index scores for each 
role are not significant (). Then we can break the Venues  Index scores down by staff 
demographics, and the geographical remoteness of the Venue/District where staff worked 
(Fig B). Venues  Index scores did not differ by demographics (), indicating the background 
of SG19 Election Staff did not affect their survey responses (?). Similary, the Venues  
Index scores did not differ by geographical remoteness ().
