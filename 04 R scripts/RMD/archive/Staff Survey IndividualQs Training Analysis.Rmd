Index analysis
=====================================

Column {data-width = 1}

Column {data-width = 12}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

\

The following analysis is based on Training questions in the SG19 staff survey,
using only complete responses (n = 1356). The original data has been transformed,
so every staff response (i.e. row) is assgined an Index score between -1 (negative 
response) and 1 (positive responses). The graphs below show the Index scores for 
questions realting to Training for each Venue/District (Fig A). Overall for SG19, 
Training questions scored similarly to other topics - statistical analysis shows that 
the Training Index scores are not significantly different to other topics (Fig A). 

\

Within the Training scores, all Roles gave mainly positive feedback, while Statistical 
analysis showed that the differences between the Training Index scores for each 
role are not significant (). Then we can break the Training Index scores down by staff 
demographics, and the geographical remoteness of the Venue/District where staff worked 
(Fig B). Training Index scores did not differ by demographics (), indicating the background 
of SG19 Election Staff did not affect their survey responses (?). Similary, the Training 
Index scores did not differ by geographical remoteness ().
