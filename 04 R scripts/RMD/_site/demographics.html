would consider a state election, but not local.   We were over-worked, under-staffed, had poor senior management. When we needed support from HQ it was not forthcoming.     The numbers of pre-polling electors was not predicted and planned for.   The IT systems were inadequate, over-worked and constantly falling over.   The new distancing rules for candidates and candidate handbills are ridiculous - 100m for Christsake. The councilor ballot papers were too complex and confusing and because electors could not pick up and bring in a 'how to vote'card our informal vote was way too high.  The RO did not know we had a referendum and would not believe me until I brought in proof from the NSW EC site.    Advertising for the pre-poll was inadequate as was the postal and i-Vote system advertising.  Pre-polling open hours were not advertised either.  Nursing home residents had to be brought into the pre=polling centre either in the rain or blistering heat to exercise their right to vote.  Thewre was only 1 pre-polling centre for the whole regional city, except for the final Friday when another - equally ill-positioned PP venue was opened for the day.",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Terrible  experience.

I see this as a privilege and human right of being Australian. I think that when you work at elections you can be a great part of that process and also make the voting experience a great and professional thing for people who vote. And when done with professionalism, integrity and empathy (which at times is needed) - when you make the voter experience better and a good one - it also means that they view voting very differently in the future. And we should be encouraging people however we can to respect and be proud of their right to vote and have their say on the governance of this country. I think all staff of the EOI have an important role in ensuring that this is a great experience for each other while working together and for anyone who is a voter (or comes with a voter) on the day. I really enjoy the working with others on the day. The ability to work as a team, problem solve and create a happy and enjoyable environment while working as well.   And above all I strongly believe in the process of everyone having the freedom to vote in a safe, happy, professional, ethical etc place when elections come around. It is vital as staff of the EOI to ensure that every person who walks through the doors of a polling booth feels that their experience there will be one that is efficient, filled with integrity and empathy and professionalism and that their votes and the counting and value of their votes will be upheld to the absolute highest and most ethical standards. If they see, feel and experience professionalism and have a good / great experience - then that is beneficial to the whole process of democracy which is what makes our country and elections such a valuable thing worth working for and striving for always. I hope as I further my experience and knowledge I can work more and at higher positions in the future for the EOI. As I truly love the job and working on election days. And hopefully more around election days in the future - as I feel that I have a lot to offer the EOI and can help further with working in more senior roles. The integrity of democracy starts at the grass roots level of the polling booth. Staff working for the EOI can be utilised and seen as a great foundation for democracy at every election. And I think that is extremely valuable.  Canâ€™t wait to do more in the future.","Enjoyed working there &amp; also met other lovely people working there","The pay is good for a single dayâ€™s work, and I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the democratic process of this nation.

Please note that as Deputy Manager I was not able to really answer a lot of this survey but still had to enter a response.","I totally loved the experience and the opportunity to work with a team of very capable people. I was able to apply my leadership and efficiently coordinate our workforce, so that everyone could have a go at each role and learn something new. I was able to identify our team members talents and allocate them to the best suited position. I felt supported by my team in every way. I truly appreciate everyoneâ€™s efforts and especially accommodating and very helpful deputy managerâ€™s assistance throughout the day","I've worked for federal, state and local elections before as well as the far more involved and larger undertaking which are the national Censuses. It's all good public services work. I'm oddly good at public service work - having been around it, worked in it on and off, most of my adult life, so I sort of understand how public service systems and people operate and think. I can intuit it well. That is not to say these public service systems are as for the public user friendly as they could or should be - and besides constant improvement is always a worthy goal. I stand ready and willing to do my part in translating public services language into the public's language. Good at it now. Kinda like it. Plus I am the public myself (I use services). I see myself in them and themselves in me (although I'm way more savvy and patient and better at it then they will ever be!), but they are my people and I feel almost a parental kind of feeling to take good care of them and deliver top notch services. Almost certainly won't make up my future career (I am half way through an intense Electrical Engineering degree right now), but I'll always have a residual soft spot for public services (and also tax accounting as I've worked in tax consultancy and know tax law). I'm one of those that takes an old school attitude to public services and public servants - i.e. it is an honour and privilege to serve the public and deliver quality for them, even when they are uncouth and disrespectful. And unlike some more modern, corporatistic attitudes on public service - I believe more in good public service is a reward in itself, and doing poorly in it degrades we the public servants just as much if not more than the public themselves. I'm always happy to engage in this kind of old school public service - not all about the money, or our own selfish interests. And it's a pride thing too. Be the best you can be. Anyways I'm getting a bit soppy here! But as corny as it all sounds - the pride in professionalism, genuine affinity for and identification with the public, old school personal code of service to the community is paramount. Corny yes, but true in my case.","I believe it is a good action to take for the community","i enjoy the whole process on election day","It was a good booth and I had great staff which made it enjoyable","Was a quite pleasant day overall.

It was also interesting to meet people","I enjoy the customer service aspect of elections.    One suggestion would be that Polling place managers should receive a thorough training before the elections. Our Polling place manager did not know what he was doing most of the time.  He also gave us wrong information in thereby asking us to get each elector to show their license and that kept getting us into trouble with some electors.  Until we told him that it does not say in any manual that we are supposed to ask for IDs.Any questions we asked him he would call out to his deputy who would then run (literally) and refer to the manual.  It was quite funny to watch actually    He did not know his job and when it came to the end after counting he kept giving wrong count and calculation to the person who he had to report to on phone as a result we were delayed for an hour.  The problem was only solved when one of the election officials intervened and helped him sort out the problem.  Most of us were unhappy with his knowledge as a manager.  He had a bit of a chip on his shoulder and kept acting like he knew everything when in reality he really knew nothing.  At one point I was wondering if he did any training at all.  I have worked in a polling booth two years ago where in the Manager was fantastic and very efficient and provided good direction to all the election officials.  The bottom line is that Polling place managers should be given a thorough training before election day.","Good to have enjoyable time with fellow workers.

My suggestion would be to reduce the number of people on the normal Electoral Role to 6 people and having a minimum 4-5 people manning the Declaration Voting.  -\tThis next suggestion is multifaceted, so this issue revolves around having the community updating their personal details. I had a lot a people that didnâ€™t have the correct address on the Electoral Role. This added to the queuing for Declaration Voting. Firstly there should be a media  campaign in the lead up to the election to help minimise this. Secondly this was major reason for increasing the number of people staffing the Declaration Voting. Thirdly I noticed that there was a QR code on the Declaration Voting table that I think was for updating voter details, could this also have been used on the Electoral Role stations?","I like to assist voters to exercise their democratic right.","Community service","it is good meeting people from different cultures and to interact with them","The work appeals to me in terms of service to the community.","I enjoy participating in the electoral process, as well as the opportunity to work with a wide range of people (both other workers and the voting public).","I found this to be an enjoyable day, well organised, a good workplace","The work is interesting and you get to meet many different people","enjoyable day  part of democracy  good pay","Ballot officer","I enjoy using my skills, while helping the election process to proceed smoothly.","The money comes to in handy.

I found the majority of the people were friendly - both the other workers and those coming to vote.  Enjoyed the day as only a Election Officer.","It's an important part of the democratic process.     I'll add the one issue re counting in case there is no other place to record this (can't see the next question). Because there were a number of officials who had worked before (and they were very strong women), they took over the count. The video training had been specific in the process. I offered to unfold and stack the votes from one ballot box but others immediately started to sort, and a couple sorted in their own piles of candidate groups with the ATL and one group for BTL. Once I finished opening my pile of ABL votes, I withdrew and stood with two other people who observed 'there were too many cooks' because the various people had to find the 'master group' and add theirs, then others started to count.  There were two scrutineers in the room and I thought they were too close and they did know one official and chatted to her because we were all just waiting by that stage. Perhaps this could be added to the manager's face-to-face training as there seemed to be an interest in finishing ASAP and an assumed 'we know what we are doing' view. I spoke with my friend who was a first-time manager (and she's strong and careful) and she said they finished counting at 7.30 and she and her Deputy (whom she said was excellent and they worked well together all day) let the people go so that they could complete the recording carefully and accurately (and stress free). In comparison, we all stood for nearly 2 hours until the manager announced the result (the deputy was not involved with the recording process)  and said we could go. While we waited, one official and I stacked the tables after the counting and packed boxed etc. Others checked that the venue doors were locked.    Perhaps the manager could be required to allot tasks (especially to those who had done it before and were dominating) and especially to check the complication additions (post-it notes) and others to be in charge of the coloured wrapping. The efficiency and correctedness of the process would depend on the number of officials - and there were apparently more staff than previously.","Opportunity to participate in electoral process.","Want to gain experience and knowledge.","An interesting experience which provides a new insight into the election process &amp; which offers opportunities to meet other officials who are part of my community.  Additional income is personally helpful.","Work was interesting and we'll organised","I feel like Iâ€™m offering my Community service and help at Elections I interact well with all people I absolutely loved working at The Election this year, giving people guidance and help.","Even though I have yet been paid for this past Ccl election!!!! I do like the personal interaction and the pay, when paid, is not bad.","It was interesting to meet electors from all walks of life and the other workers were very nice.  I would like to see the process improved in the future as the current process is extremely archaic, that is not befitting of Australia as a developed democracy.","It was very efficiently run, and while a long day, made enjoyable by our manager and other staff.","It can be an interesting task meeting people also interacting with them and the extra money is always helpful.","I think it's always a great day and I enjoy the chance to meet and work with so many new people.

Pay is reasonable. We worked well as a team at our Polling Centre. It was a pleasant and safe, well-ventilated, working environment. Covid-19 risks were well addressed. I was impressed with how well the population has been trained in use of QR codes on entry, and use of masks (supplied if voters forgot to bring their own). No voters complained at Covid-safe processes. I was also impressed with supply of individual pens.   Impressed with overall ethics of the election process.     Only sticking point was in my setting up my personal account for pay online. I was told that I could advise my superannuation provider if I didn't want to use NSW EC's default. However, I couldn't find out how to do this. After several phone calls to my local managers, and some considerable time searching on my login on the website, then phoning the Helpdesk, it turned out that I didn't earn enough (by just $25) to merit superannuation payment, so the tab did not appear in my payment portal. I think it should be explained in the account portal that if an employee earns less than $500, then the superannuation tab will not be visible as no super is paid.","I have an enjoyable day.

I took the initiative in many instances during the day assisting the team with their questions and other important tasks like making sure the ballot box was not left unsupervised, voters were using the QR codes and not sneaking in through the Exit Door etc. Next time I would like to be the Deputy as a minimum as it was very frustrating working in this team with ineffective direction and communication. I knew what to do as I paid attention to the on-line training and as a regular voter over many many years I have hard lots of exposure to polling booths. The aspects of counting are straightforward and the team we had on the day were very organised in the counting.

We were required to put our office hours as 8.45 to 5.15 with half hr break.  Many of us worked considerably longer hrs than what we were â€˜forcedâ€™ to enter in that 2 week period, and as it was so busy, there was not the opportunity to take a half hr lunch break, it was more like 15 minute lunch break at most, especially in latter part of the 2 week period.   This was felt by all employees working at Manly PrePoll, and I felt sorry for Michel who worked longer hours at the end of day tallying with Nigel, however he had to take extra time off at lunch time or come in later in morning so that he was inside the â€˜enforced timesheetâ€™.  This is not fair pay for fair day.  There was no chance for discussion about the longer days, even though we all pitched in and made it work. No one minded working, but it was the opinion of each employee there that to get all that was required in a day, could not be achieved in that 8.45 start, and 5.15 clock off.
