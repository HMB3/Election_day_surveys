She bluntly refused and said on election day at 6:30 am they used to set up and used to be ok. She never heard anyone set up a day earlier and  said not written in manual any where.  She then argued that she would have taken PPM position if had to set up a day earlier.    My DEPUTY POLLING PLACE MANAGER (ROSALIE BAUTISTA)   DID NOT COME FOR THE SET UP ON 3 DECEMBER.  I was alone for 20 minutes; I called one of my election official for a helping hand and did the  set up completely.  When we were about to close; she came for a flying visit. She did not contribute to set up, just made a round and left saying it is not COVID safe and people are going to complain and we have to move and how I will do it?  I  had smsed my staff way in advance stating for  them to wear face shield for additional protection if they prefer and also not mandatory but face mask a must.    On 4 th Dec, my staff reached by 7:15 am I started briefing there she interrupted and caused disturbance.   When not favourable task she had to do , she would rant or make some excuse or order loudly in front of staff to me that she would taken PPM job if that was so.   If the task was difficult she would come with the rant.      She told me she was going on a break and from the staff came to know that BIL (brother in law met with a serious accident and in Liverpool hospital with brain damage.)   When she came back I tried to ask her she did not tell me and on the phone was laughing and talking to someone.    After 3 hours she told me about this and was pressurizing the staff to complete fast.  I told her you can go to hospital and we will complete the remaining instead was creating disturbances.  After 6 pm I wanted to record the account of ballot papers- councillor. She snatched the authorized roll header book from my hand and tried to close it.  She disturbed and interrupted and said what the rest of staff will do, I said they will watch the {video of count and sort} but she wanted to do the short cut way and did not let them watch video.     However,  I did not argue and create a battlefield in front of the staff, she raised her voice and said that again, I could have been PPM.    With no peace of mind I  filled up the account of ballot papers- councillor and when I went to oversee and instruct she did not let me  and said in front of staff. Everything one person cannot do   which is totally wrong.       I was starting to brief, she said no to that too;  I had made miniature cutouts of sorting signs for councilor ballot papers with GVS to explain  and for the staff to watch sort and count VIDEO on  thereby.    She said it is waste of time to watch sort and count VIDEO    video.  She interrupted and told them to do counting fast emptied the ballot paper without matching the seal number. I said it was against the protocol and I had to match each seal numbers thereby.     In front of EO she was creating confusion, disturbances and  blaming me that I do not know  to delegate. It was difficult to control her, just creating havoc scenario.  She pushed all papers without asking me and try to pack all ballot papers in a haphazard way without following rules  of manual I had to redo the entire packing with disturbances from her.

We were given an e-introduction via our RO. Mike emailed me first and gave me his mobile numberâ€¦. It took me up until the election-eve to realise that he had supplied an incorrect number. I should have used the number supplied by the RO. As a consequence of Mike supplying the wrong number, he was very difficult to communicate with. I was leaving voicemail messages and sending SMSes with no response. He only ever replied via email, which was generally slower than the voice or SMS.    At the conclusion of the Training on Monday 29th November, I told Mike that it is likely that the setup time on Friday would be 4:30pm.    As it turns out, I was able to reschedule some things to collect the keys from the school at 3:30pm (swap materials with Bankstown West PS) and then start setup. I had left a voicemail and SMS for Mike to inform him of the new time. He didnâ€™t get any of them. He then emailed me after 4:30pm asking what time to start. I replied straight away, to which he indicated he was 5 minutes away. 25 minutes later, he turned up. I had already completed 80-90% of the 'heavy lifting' in the setup.    I asked Mike to put up the posters/signs, assuming that common sense would prevail. Unfortunately that was not true. Whilst I gave general indications on where to put posters, Mike seemed to put them up haphazardly. I corrected some of these after he left around 8pm.    On election day, I was about to delegate the job of meal/break allocation to Mike, but quickly changed my mind, as I remembered how unreliable he was so far.    I tried to educate Mike on how to allocate people to appropriate tables (given we had ballot papers for all five wards). He simply didnâ€™t get it. Where people lived in a suburb that covered two wards (e.g. Condell Park, Punchbowl or Yagoona), he seemed to be incapable of helping people line up at the correct table. As a result people often waited in the wrong line, and had to line up again for a second (and sometimes 3rd) time.    During the afternoon, I asked Mike to relieve someone at the Declaration Vote tables. He (very nicely) refused.    I would not recommend Mike to be a PPM or DPPM. Iâ€™m not even sure he would be a good DVIO.    Bankstown Public School - Commendations  Newton Quach (Staff ID: G0765848) was an EXCELLENT team member. On more than one occasion, when we were encountering difficulties with the Dec Vote table, he was able to step in and provide support to other team members and get things back on track. As we came closer to 6pm, I realised that I would not have the margin to set up for the count, so I indicated to Newtown that I wanted him to be responsible for all the Dec Vote counts (5 wards). I gave him the PPM manual to ready himself.    Newton did an excellent job coordinating the Dec Vote table and the Dec Vote count.
