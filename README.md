# Election Day Survey
The analysis in this report is based on the results of an Election Staff Survey, following the 
NSW Local Government Election held on 4th December, 2021. The results use only complete survey 
responses. Election staff surveys have a consistently high response rate, usually with upwards of 
10 thousand respondents across seven main job roles. There are currently 184 survey questions.
While itâ€™s great to have lots of responses, collecting such a large, complex data set creates 
major challenges for timely analysis and dissemination of insights. We present here an automated 
report that provide simple results to business users within days of the survey closing. 
Each page shows responses to individual questions by topic.



# **Response rate** 
The survey was emailed to around 29 thousand temporary election staff members between 15/12/2021 and 22/12/2021. 
The overall response rate was approximately 37 per cent, with 10,089 completed surveys (a completed survey response 
rate of 35 per cent). The highest response rate was from Polling Place Managers (over 50 per cent) and lowest for 
OA's (less than 20 per cent; see Table 1).
