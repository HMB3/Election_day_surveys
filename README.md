# Election Day Survey
The analysis in this report is based on the results of the Election Staff Survey, following the 
Local Government Election held on 4th December, 2021. The results use only complete survey responses. 



# **Response rate** 
The survey was emailed to around 29 thousand temporary election staff members between 15/12/2021 and 22/12/2021. 
The overall response rate was approximately 37 per cent, with 10,089 completed surveys (a completed survey response 
rate of 35 per cent). The highest response rate was from Polling Place Managers (over 50 per cent) and lowest for 
OA's (less than 20 per cent; see Table 1).

# Work health safety guidelines 
The NSWEC implemented a new suite of WHS guidelines at this election, and the results show that most staff   
reported compliance with the measures. Figure 1 shows that the vast majority of staff stated they finished   
work before the mandated 11pm cut-off on election night. Although 12 per cent of respondents had some WHS   
concerns (Q169), overall, the WHS and COVID-safe measures were well received. Ninety five per cent of   
respondents were satisfied with the COVID-safe measures (Q2).




**Figure 1.** Number of staff finishing work at different times on Election Day. Each grey bar represents 
the number of staff finishing at a given time. The red line is the overall median finishing time (the middle 
value of all the finishing times). This plot shows that the vast majority of staff completed work prior to 11pm 
on election night.



# Overall employee satisfaction 
Election staff were generally satisfied with how the election was run, with most questions across all topics having 
satisfaction ratings greater than 80 per cent, and dissatisfaction ratings less than 10 per cent (see Table of 
Contents: All satisfaction responses; Figure 5).
