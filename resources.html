Another minor issue was that the account of ballots forms in the register uses a different formula for the cell labelled K than the cell with the same label on the results sheet that we use to phone in initial counts, which means that if the total number after the initial count is different than the total number after accounting, the values do not match and cause issues when phoning in the results (in our case, the Mayor count had one fewer ballots after the initial count, which was comfortably within the 1% tolerance, but seemed to cause a lot of confusion for the RO trying to enter the numbers).
